WORA(Write Once Run AnyWhere)
java is independent platform bcz ot this byte code concept bcz of across all the platform
byte code will be understood by the jvm not by the nrml users
 along vth jdk, jvm also will be there and jre as well 
if any device is having jdk we can run the clss file in that.
.clss file contains byte codes.
note: .clss file it self is not platform independent but the byte code which is available vth in the .clss file.
While executing in other platforms(os) we dont need to change the source code regrding tp the system architecture,thnks tobytecode nd JVM.
